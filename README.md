# Stakers Draw
This is a decentralised application that allows it's users to perform the following action

1. Mint new NFTs and add to their collection
2. Create a pot where others can stake their NFTs
3. Stake your NFT into pot created by other users

**Note**
- Each pot created has a limit to the number of NFTs it can take in. 
- Each pot cannot take in more than it's limit.
- Anyone can stake as many NFTs as possible to increase their chance of winning (just ensure you own the NFTs).
- Once the pot is filled, a winner is randomly selected (the last staker triggers the pot to select the winner).
- Once winner is selected, all NFTs in the pot is sent to winner.
- Pot is then set to closed (No longer accepting NFTs)
